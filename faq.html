              <summary>Is working out in the morning better for you?</summary>
              <p class="text">You should exercise at a time that suits you and your body. There’s no evidence to suggest that an early morning workout is better for you, but some people are just more efficient at this time.</p>
           </details>
           <details>
              <summary>Should I approach my sessions with a plan?</summary>
              <p class="text">Yes this will help you get the most out of your workout. Decide which muscle groups you want to work on, whether you’re doing a strength session or a HIIT workout and what equipment you’ll need. That way, you won’t waste time procrastinating and you’ll work harder as a result.</p>
           </details>
           <details>
              <summary>Do I need to work out every day?</summary>
              <p class="text">A good workout week doesn’t necessarily mean training every day. Three to four gym or home workouts each week is enough if you work as hard as you can in each session. Try to balance the week with a mix of cardio, HIIT, strength, and yoga or Pilates. However, when it comes to being active you should aim to move as much as you can every day!</p>
           </details>
           <details>
            <summary>For how long do I need to work out?</summary>
            <p class="text">This depends on your fitness levels, what type of training you’re doing and what intensity you’re training at. Just remember, something is always better than nothing. If you only have 30 minutes, try to fit in a quick HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) workout or go for a run.

                If you’re doing a strength workout, set aside more time for warming up and mobilising to help avoid injury and make sure you’re getting enough rest between sets. Either way, you definitely don’t need to be slogging it out for hours!</p>

            <summary>Do I need to vary my workout to see results?</summary>
            <p class="text">If you want to see real change in your body you need to mix up your routine. The body quickly adapts to exercise and if you continue to do the same workout or use the same weights, it will plateau as it stops responding to the training stimulus.</p>

            <summary>How do I get a six-pack?</summary>
            <p class="text">Doing 100 sit-ups a day won’t guarantee a defined set of abs; you’ll need to do a combination of things. Reducing body fat should be first on the agenda – you may have the strongest set of abdominal muscles but if your body fat percentage is too high, you won’t be able to see them.

                Be sure to include some fat-burning HIIT training and cardio in your routine. However, diet is arguably the most important factor if you want to get lean. Use apps such as My Fitness Pal to track your calorie intake and if weight loss is your goal, ensure you are in a calorie deficit (burning more calories than you eat).
                
                When you’ve reached your body fat goals, it’s time to target the abdominals and increase their muscle mass through your training. Great core exercises include plank variations, bicycle crunches and cable rotations, or try abs-specific classes at the gym.</p>

           <details>
              <summary> How often do I need to rest?</summary>
              <p class="text">Ensure you have at least one rest day per week to allow your body to regenerate and repair, so you can come back stronger.</p>
           </details>
           <details>
              <summary>When should I stretch and how often?</summary>
              <p class="text">Start with some dynamic stretching (active muscular stretching such as walking lunges or jogging with high knees) before a workout. Then, do static stretches such as a standing thigh stretch or side lunge for post-workout recovery, focusing on the muscles you’ve worked. This will decrease your risk of injury, improve blood flow and circulation, increase your range of motion and improve muscle function. You can never stretch too much!</p>

              <summary>How does exercise help mental health?</summary>
              <p class="text">Research has shown that exercise can help to reduce stress, improve your self-confidence, alleviate anxiety and improve concentration. Plus, it releases endorphins, which encourage feelings of happiness.

                Be careful not to over train, as this can put your body and mind under stress, raising levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Therefore a balanced exercise plan is key.</p>

              <summary>What’s the best way to help sore muscles?</summary>
              <p class="text">Diet plays a vital role in the rate at which your body can recover – protein is crucial for decreasing muscle damage and soreness after a workout, so make sure to fuel up properly. Rest and plenty of sleep will also give the body time to repair.

                Treat yourself to a bath with Epsom salts, which are packed with magnesium that will gently relax muscles. Or try foam rolling, which acts as a self-massage and prevents damage to the connective tissue between the muscles.</p>
           </details>
           <details>
              <summary>How and when do I need to use a foam roller?</summary>
              <p class="text">Foam rolling acts as a deep tissue massage, which will help to improve mobility and flexibility. Rolling pre-workout will prepare your body for exercise and increase circulation to the muscles you are preparing to train. Post-workout, foam rolling is a great recovery tool, as it removes lactic acid (a waste product your body produces during exercise) from your muscles.</p>

            <summary>Any PROPER WAY TO BREATHE DURING SPORT?</summary>
            <p class="text">You should never hold your breath when doing sport. Often, you breathe in during the prep phase, and breathe out during effort. For example, when doing squats, breathe in as you bend your knees and go down, and breathe out when you straighten your legs to come back up. There is one exception to this rule: for exercises that require effort as you expand your chest (such as horizontal pulls), you should breathe in during the effort.</p>
